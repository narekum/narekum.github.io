      <description>Department of Biotechnology, Government of India recently concluded a very special event – the official Nobel Prize Series, 2019 – at one of its premier institutes NABI at Mohali, and Punjab Agricultural University in Ludhiana. The series organized talks on Teaching and Learning, a theme inspired by personal experiences of many Nobel Laureates about how teachers motivated them towards literature, politics and science. Two Nobel Laureates, Mr. Kailash Satyarthi (Peace, 2014) and Dr Serge Haroche (2012, Physics) were part of the inaugural function.</description>

      <description>One of the frustrating things bioinformaticians encounter routinely is the incompatibities among packages and their dependencies when they upgrade a package. An update is recommended because it usually offers more efficient, elegant and secure functionalities to the users. However, this comes at a price. An update may break an existing workflow or pipelines installed on the system. Figuring out what went wrong and what other dependencies need to be upgraded can be a time consuming task.</description>
